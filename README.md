## greased palms

From 1984 to currently 2025. 41 years the US govrenemnt has been corporate and billionaire centric. Almost every new law enacted has been pro-rich, pro-corporate and anti-healthcare, anti-middle class.

The pace of lowering taxes for bilolonaires and corpoate people-hood is astounding.

Trillions have moved from EVERYONE to the greediest .001% just since 1984. Reaganomics is killing democracy. Reagan was worse than Trump.
He deregulated big oil and made the world filthy and uninhabitable.

he deregulated the media forming Fox 'news'. Stupid 'boomers' only news source. 

7.2 million Americans march against Trump and his sycophants & are labelled Hamas and anti-democrats. No arrests. No injuries=. No murders.

# Neo-liberalism 
- Neoliberalism is a political and economic philosophy that emphasizes free-market capitalism, deregulation, and minimal 
government intervention in the economy. It advocates for shifting economic control from the public sector to the private sector and 
promotes policies such as privatization, free trade, and fiscal austerity. The term was coined in the 1930s but gained prominence in the 
1970s and 1980s as a response to perceived failures of state-led economic models. It is heavily associated with the policies implemented 
by leaders like U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. President Ronald Reagan.
