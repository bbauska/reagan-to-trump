## greased palms

From 1984 to currently 2025. 41 years the US govrenemnt has been corporate and billionaire centric. Almost every new law enacted has been pro-rich, pro-corporate and anti-healthcare, anti-middle class.

The pace of lowering taxes for bilolonaires and corpoate people-hood is astounding.

Trillions have moved from EVERYONE to the greediest .001% just since 1984. Reaganomics is killing democracy. Reagan was worse than Trump.
He deregulated big oil and made the world filthy and uninhabitable.

he deregulated the media forming Fox 'news'. Stupid 'boomers' only news source. 

7.2 million Americans march against Trump and his sycophants & are labelled Hamas and anti-democrats. No arrests. No injuries=. No murders.
